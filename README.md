# RGB

Frontend for remotly adjusting the color of an internet connected light.

The code is heavily inspired by [piknik](https://github.com/arnemart/piknik) and then rewritten in Elm for fun.
It uses the [Eclipse Paho client library](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/#)
for communicating with their [public MQTT broker](https://iot.eclipse.org/getting-started/#sandboxes).
